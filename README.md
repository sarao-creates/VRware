# VRware
VRware is a startup based out of UNC Chapel Hill that aims to help entrepreneurs, consultants, lawyers, politicans, and other professions with presentations. 

Our goal is to design a Virtual Reality app that allows you to immerse yourself in a realistic environment for presentations. You'll be able to record your presentation via the headset and view analytics for your speech and body movement on our web application: vrware.tech

Since then, I've been leaading VR development â€“ designing the scenes for our presentations, UI for users, and body position tracking (pacing movement, hand movement, and eye tracking).
