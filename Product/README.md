# VRWare Scenes
This repository contains the contents of the VRWare software scenes. The scenes include the Shark Tank Scene and Shuford Suite Scene (more to come) 

# Getting Started
To access these scenes, simply download the repository's contents and run them with Unreal Engine. There are currently 3 main maps you'll need to work with:
1. Main Menu Map - a map that contains the Main Menu UI as well as a "waiting room."
2. Shark Tank Map - a map that enables students to practice their pitches in a high-pressure, grand scene mimicking a scenario of the popular TV Show Shark Tank
3. Shuford Suite Map - a map that enables students to practice their pitches in UNC's very own, Shuford Entrepreneurship Program Suite, in front of professors.

# Build and Test
To build and run the scene, we utilized the Oculus Quest headset. 

You'll need to complete some initial setup of the Oculus Quest, which can be found here:

After setting up your headset, you can launch the scenes to the Oculus Quest via Launch>Quest. 
It is suggested you launch the scene from the Main Menu to get the natural, first experience.
